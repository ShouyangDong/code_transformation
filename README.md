# Program Synthesis

## What this does

- Search for low operation cost methods for GCD choosing between two algorithm loop bodies usin Z3 SMT solver

## Why

- To explore program synthesis and satisfiability analyses

## Inspired by

- [CS6120 L13](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/lesson/13/) [Program Synthesis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/minisynth.html) [Tutorial](https://github.com/sampsyo/minisynth)
